✅ Day _5 - Advanced Face Detection and Tracking

*Face detection is a computer technology being used in a variety of application that identifies human faces in digital images.

*with face detection, you can get the information you need to perform tasks like embellishing selfies and portraits, or generating avatars from a user's photo because ML kit can perform face detetion in real time, you can use it in application like video chat or games that respond to the player's expression.



Haar Cascade Frantal Face Algorithm
----------------------------------
*It is based on the Haar wavelet technique to analyze pixel in the image into squares by function.

*This users machine learning techniques to get high degree of accuracy from what is called "features data".

*This uses "integral image" concept to compute the "features" detected.

*Haar Cascades use the Adaboost learning algorithm which selects a small number of important features from a large set to give an efficient result of classifiers.




detectMultiScale
----------------
#faces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(src, scalefactor, minNeighbors)

faces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(img, 1.3, 4)

scalefactor : Parameter specifying how much the image size is reduced at each image scale

minNeighbors : Parameter specifying how many neighbors each candidate rectangle should have to retain it.
